# 🚴 Adventure Works Cycles - Sales Performance & Recovery Analysis

## 📊 Sales Optimization:

In this project, I focused on reversing the sales decline of **Adventure Works Bicycles**. Using **SQL Server** and **Power BI**, I managed and visualized large datasets from the **AdventureWorksDW2019** database and Excel files to generate effective solutions.

## 🔍 Optimization Process:

- **Relational Data Modeling**: Restored and connected key system tables to create a robust data model, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
  
- **Data Transformation**: Applied advanced data cleaning and normalization techniques using **Power Query**, optimizing the structure of data and adding calculated columns for deeper analysis.

- **KPI & Key Metric Calculation**: Created custom measures using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** in **Power BI** to track critical indicators such as revenue, profit margins, and sales trends.

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Designed user-friendly dashboards to explore insights by region, product type, and time period.

- **Key Factor Detection**: Identified issues in the supply chain, shifts in consumer behavior, and the impact of competition to generate effective strategies.
